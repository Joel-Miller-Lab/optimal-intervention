1. Simulation for multi-group optimal intervention

2. Typically epidemic modelling involves assumptions where a diverse population is coarse grained into few a groups, say by age, and is studied using the next generation matrix. In the case of optimal intervention where the objective is to avoid a 2nd wave and reduce the epidemic size, such coarse graining may fail to recognise outlier groups due to the inherent averaging assumptions involved.
